      <description>An R package that calculates summary indices for built environment characteristics.
Overview extRatum is a package used to provide summary statistics of local geospatial features within a given geographic area. It does so by calculating the area covered by a target geospatial feature (i.e. buildings, parks, lakes, etc.). The geospatial features can be of any type of geospatial data, including point, polygon or line data. For examples of extRatum functionalities follow this link and for the package website this link.</description>

      <description>Inequality is a major global challenge. Yet, understanding of the evolving spatial structure of inequalites at high levels of spatial resolution over time remains lacking.
This website is dedicated to summarise the outputs of a project on spatial inequalities in Britain over a fourty-year period between 1971 and 2011. The project was funded by the UKRI (ESRC) and supported by the Ordnance Survey through the Data Analytics and Society Centre for Doctoral Training.</description>
