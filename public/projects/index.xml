      <description>An R package that calculates summary indices for built environment characteristics.
Overview extRatum is a package used to provide summary statistics of local geospatial features within a given geographic area. It does so by calculating the area covered by a target geospatial feature (i.e. buildings, parks, lakes, etc.). The geospatial features can be of any type of geospatial data, including point, polygon or line data. For examples of extRatum functionalities follow this link and for the package website this link.</description>
